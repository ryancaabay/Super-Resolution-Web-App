Super-Resolution Imaging (SR) is a category of processing techniques that aim to enhance the resolution of an imaging system. It is a classical computer vision task that aims to accomplish the conversion of images from lower to higher resolutions. With the thriving development of deep learning (DL) technology, more and more researchers are dedicated to the research of image SR techniques based on DL. As a response, the goal is to develop a web-based application to demonstrate the state-of-the-art DL method for SR image processing.
